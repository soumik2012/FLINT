**What was the decision and why?**

Kenya will use a pixel-based approach to estimating carbon stock change at the pixel level in remote-sensing applications. At the pixel level, it is essentially a gain-loss method being employed, estimating the change in carbon stock, based on pixels which have been classified using land use strata. However, on aggregate the approach can be categorized as a stock change approach.

**Why was the decision necessary?**

A method for assigning carbon values to various land use and disturbance related data was needed in order to quantify potential emissions from land use and land use change. In order to capitalize on the availability of donated satellite imagery, leveraging existing data sets, and expert knowledge, and combined with an increase of accuracy inherent in this method, Kenya has decided to classify each pixel and assign a carbon stock value for each pixel according to its land use. This may also serve to increase the accuracy as expert interpolation of each pixel will be used.

**How was the decision reached?**

The decision to use a pixel based approach was necessitated by the lack of historic land use change records for Kenya, combined with the desire to use a Tier 3 reporting level for the purposes of the UNFCCC.  The availability of satellite imagery over multiple epochs allowed Kenyan experts in consultation with international institutions to see the merit in a pixel-based approach at early stages of the design process.
