SLEEK delivers an essential decision-making support platform to the stakeholders in government, civil society, and the private sector, by providing an accurate, multiple input approach, layering information from multiple sectors. This allows decisions to be supported by projecting impacts over time and cross-sectorally. A reliable, affordable, and centralized data platform in Kenya can inform on crop suitability, cropping patterns, reforestation potential and appropriate methods for land- use and management as well as many other applications.
 
Kenya has chosen to use a multiple input approach as this provides greater accuracy over a wider variety of landscapes. These multiple inputs include field-based measurements from permanent sampling plots, remotely sensed change detection inputs from satellite imagery and where large data-gaps exist, outputs from scientific models, all collected and  This robust approach allows Kenya to continually refine inputs and results in improved accuracy over the long term. It also allows for multiple redundancies within the system so that the system can continue to deliver outputs even when one source of data may be interrupted or is no longer available. 
The SLEEK has many parts or components. The interactions between these parts is what makes the SLEEK both complex, but also extremely valuable, as components can be exchanged or improved upon over time and depending on the dynamics of land use in the country. This makes the system incredibly adaptable.
The components are as follows: 

**Data Platform:** The data platform is essentially the interface between the user and the data system. 
 
**Data cube:** The data cube includes layers of multidimensional data values, and in the case of SLEEK this is represented in spatial data in the form of historical imagery. This allows the SLEEK to represent land use and land use change over a time series by comparing data values of each pixel through time.
 
**Scheduler**: This component essentially tells the models when and how often to run calculations.

**The FLINT and the Input models:** The Full Land-based Integration Tool (FLINT) is essentially a large calculator which collects land use data from sources (primarily outputs of models), and calculates emissions associated with the land use reported based on parameters set by contextual data the it is fed. This data can come from multiple sources, including existing datasets, expertise and scientific modeling. The inputs on the land use are generated by the various models (RothC for soil, WOFOST for crops etc.). These models exist as separate components and can be used when and where data gaps exist. They can also be replaced by improved methods over time without impacting the functioning of the FLINT, making the entire system very flexible and dynamic. An example of how the FLINT handles forest related data can be found in the following diagram:

Presentation component: Data will be accessed and presented through multiple avenues. The primary avenue of access will be a public, cloud-based interface. This interface will allow various levels of access depending on the audience. Additional access will be provided through applications developed specifically for specialized user groups and populated with output data as appropriate.
