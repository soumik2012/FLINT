SLEEK was initially seen as a single tool to deliver a comprehensive view of the land use sector in Kenya by incorporating all data, models, and applications into a single accessible platform.  The idea was to create a single resource that would be accessible by multiple users, across spatial and temporal scales. However, as the reality of SLEEK's design began to take shape, the stakeholders began to understand the more dynamic role that SLEEK may play by using a dis-aggregated and generic approach, usable by a larger audience.
