Kenya is embarking on an ambitious growth and development trajectory which is captured in both the constitution and the Vision 2030. Kenya is aiming to be a middle-income nation, as defined by the World Bank, by 2030. In order to achieve this objective, Kenya will need to support development across all sectors and this support in turn will need to be guided by decision making processes which are supported by accurate data and projections. Additionally, Kenya's commitment to a low carbon development trajectory will need to be carefully balanced with the aspirational development scenarios inherent in a growing economy.

The SLEEK programme is designed to deliver multiple outputs such as data on emissions to meet the reporting obligations to the UNFCCC. However, and equally important another major output is data to fill a gap surrounding land use decisions across all major land based sectors. This data is expected to act as a decision support tool for everything from forest and watershed management decisions, to crop choices, and land use. In a very real sense, the SLEEK will be used to foster a culture of decision-making based on and supported by, accurate data. By increasing the availability and accessibility of this data, decision makers will have the tools needed to ensure Kenya meets the objectives inherent in Vision 2030.
