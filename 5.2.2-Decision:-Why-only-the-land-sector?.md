**Why does SLEEK only focus on the land sector?**

In Kenya, SLEEK will account for emissions from the land-based sector. The choice to address emissions from the land sector was made during the design process and is the product of an evaluation of both Kenya's needs and the contextual reality. For example, SLEEK attempts to address Kenya's needs by providing data on emissions fluxes that can be used across multiple sectors and reporting requirements. "The IPCC suggests that the most effort on quantifying emissions should be spent on those sources that are the most critical: those that make up the largest quantity, are responsible for the greatest increase or decrease, or have the highest level of uncertainty associated with them" (Environment Canada, 2015). Contextual realities in Kenya, namely a high percentage of the population practicing agricultural and pastoralist livelihoods, means that Kenya's major sources of emissions are likely to be from land-use, and land use change situations. However, a dearth of data for measuring, verifying and reporting on this with any degree of certainty was identified as a major barrier and gap in Kenya's ability to plan, act or report on emissions (GoK, 2002). In this sense SLEEK acts as an MRV tool that can be used to meet the requirements of not only Kenya's UNFCCC reporting requirements but also in its emerging National REDD+ Programme, as a MRV system. Additional examples of the utility of the SLEEK are in the State of Environment (SOE) reporting, a decision support tool in planning and through providing data for applications.

**Why was the decision necessary?**

As an emerging economy in a developing country, Kenya's largest economic sectors have traditionally been land-based agricultural or rangeland management. Combined with a relatively high population, agricultural pressure for land has resulted in high rates of conversion of land to agricultural uses. Because of this conversion, agriculture is Kenya's largest source of emissions. Furthermore, in 2012, The Ministry of Forests and Wildlife commissioned a study of Drivers of Deforestation in Kenya and found that in the process of this conversion to agricultural land, a key source of emissions was the production of charcoal as a fuelwood for both domestic and export use. Historical datasets, measuring this conversion are available for some areas of Kenya, and when combined with new and emerging field-based measurement exercises, and ancillary evidence, evidence for the scale of land-based emissions is being further refined and will be greatly enhanced by the SLEEK.

During the SLEEK design process, the stakeholders decided that Kenya will report its emissions using Approach 3, Tier 3 of the IPCC Guidance on National Emissions. This means that Kenya has committed to a level of reporting that includes field based measurements, and spatially explicit representations of land uses. Emissions from land use, also known by the UNFCCC category of Agriculture, Forestry and Other Land Use (AFOLU), are thought to account for the majority of Kenya's emissions. By focusing on accounting for AFOLU emissions in Kenya, and subsequently implementing measures to decrease those emissions, it also allows Kenya potential access to the most robust emissions reductions markets, adding a prospect for longer term financial sustainability through emissions reductions, such as those generated through the country's emerging National REDD+ Programme.

**How was the decision reached?**

The decision to limit Kenya's current reporting on the land-based sector was based on the advice of technical experts, and the design process of SLEEK, which involved multiple consultations with stakeholders in both the government and civil society. During the design process of SLEEK, key criteria for choosing to report on AFOLU emissions through the SLEEK were identified as follows:

1. Identifying where Kenya's largest sources of emissions are already
1. Identifying a financially sustainable and efficient way to measure these emissions in data-deficient areas
1. Identifying a system that could potentially be self-sustaining through the sale of emissions reduction offsets

In terms of measuring and and reporting against those emissions potentials, Kenya has sought to find an effective and efficient manner for compiling this data. The choice of the SLEEK to use models in data deficient areas allows for significant knowledge gaps to be filled. Coupled with the use of freely available remote sensing products, this is an example of the financial efficiency that is being used in SLEEK.  Additionally, this system creates an iterative environment and process where accuracy can be continually improved upon over time. 

The contextual reality of Kenya is that the majority of emissions are believed to come from land-based activities such as agriculture and rangeland uses such as pastoralism.
