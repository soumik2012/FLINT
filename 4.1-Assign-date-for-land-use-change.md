**Assign date for land-use change**

Assigning a date for land-use change is a special example of interpolation. Because observations of land-use change are not continuous, it is necessary to make an assumption about when the land use change actually occurred. Both inventory and remote sensing based systems are subject to this issue.
 
The figure above depicts where an observation at T1 identifies the land use for a unit of land as forest, and an observation at T6 identifies the land use as cropland. The time at which the land-use change to cropland actually occurred is only known to be sometime after T1 but before T6. While this discussion could quickly evolve into a philosophy question about Schrodinger’s cat, we will instead focus upon interpolation. In situations such as this, interpolation can be used to assign a date of land use change, other than just assuming that the land use change occurred on the date of the observation of the new land use. The logical interpolation methods for assigning a date for land-use change include:

* Random – a date is randomly selected from the period between the two observations
* Random plus specified date ranges – a date is randomly assigned within a specified date range, or a series of specified date ranges. As an example, it may only be logical to plant trees during a normal planting season eg autumn and spring. In this case it would be sensible to constrain the random allocation to the spring nad autumn planting seasons.
* Set date – specify a particular date. This would include making the assumption that the land use change occurs on the date the observation took place.
* Probability distributions – for example where known patterns of land-use change can be used as auxiliary data to specify probabilities between date ranges. Another example could be linked to rainfall dependencies, where planting or clearing only occurs under certain rainfall conditions.

On an even more sophisticated level, the simulator could consider the spatial distribution of change. The simulator could look at neighbourhoods and of change and assign dates based upon what is happening in the ‘neighbourhood’. This could be used to clump change and assign the same or similar dates to land use change that occurs within close proximity.
