The Government of Kenya has the overall responsibility for the SLEEK. The effective management of SLEEK development by the GoK is not only vital to successfully building the system, but it is critical for the program’s operations and sustainability. Ideally, the external interactions of the SLEEK are as follows:

Internally, the SLEEK program requires a delivery mechanism that can ensure effective expenditures for concrete deliverables as well as value for money. A framework was discussed at a Stakeholder Workshop held on 7 August 2012 and a Writing Workshop held on 8–9th August 2012. Although there is some level of dynamic progression in the SLEEK design, the key program functional units are described below and identified in the following figure.

**Program Steering Committee (PSC)**

Policy decisions are the responsibility of the PSC. The PSC meets twice per year with the head of PMU as secretary; members of the steering committee have been drawn from line ministries and may include other representation as required, including potentially the private sector. CCI will serve as a temporary member during the three years of program implementation and then retire. The Australian Department of Climate Change and Energy Efficiency will sit on the PSC as an observer and will provide input on particular needs as required. Gender representation is a priority in line with Kenya's constitutional requirements. 

**Program Management Unit (PMU)**

The PMU is housed in the Ministry of Environment and Natural Resources and is responsible for day- to-day monitoring and reporting on the program. Its membership includes technical capacity. CCI will play a role in the PMU for the duration of the SLEEK program, with the national system functional units continuing their roles and responsibilities in sustaining and improving the system as part of the machinery of government. Gender representation is a priority in line with Kenya's constitutional requirements. 

**Technical Advisory Group (TAG)**

The TAG meets quarterly. Members include the head of the PMU as secretary, element working group team leaders as members, CCI as a member, and DCCEE invited as necessary for specific topics/areas to contribute to specific identified needs. Gender representation is a priority in line with Kenya's constitutional requirements.

**Element working groups (EWG)**

EWGs of technical and policy experts were established for each of the seven program components and for any new emerging themes that are allocated to relevant lead agencies. These have included following EWGs: Forest Biomass, Crop Growth and Parameters, Climate Parameters, Land Cover Change, Soil, and a Modelling group.
