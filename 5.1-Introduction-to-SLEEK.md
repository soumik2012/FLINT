In 2005, at the 11th session of the Conference of Parties to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC), the parties urged developing countries to begin to design systems to track emissions of greenhouse gases (GHGs) from land use, land use change and forestry. Further to this, the Cancun Agreements, arising out of the COP Decision 1/CP.16 articulated the fundamental structures that would be needed for countries to operationalize REDD+ at the national level in member states, including a system for monitoring emissions from the land-based sector. 

The System for Land Based Emissions Estimation in Kenya (SLEEK) is a national level monitoring system for measuring GHGs from the land use sector in Kenya and delivering key data to support decision-making, planning and management in the land sector. Essentially, the SLEEK allows users to measure GHG fluxes across all land-based sectors, tracking both emissions and removals. The SLEEK enables the Government of Kenya to quantify and report its land sector emissions. It also allows Kenya to evaluate different land-use scenarios for sustainable development and inform policy decisions on resource use, including planning for forest restoration, protection of forest resources, improved agricultural productivity, and enhanced water availability. In this respect, the SLEEK acts as an important decision support tool for Kenya across multiple sectors and time scales. For example,acts as an important monitoring tool in Kenya's national forest monitoring system and emerging national REDD+ strategy.

The SLEEK has two key components: (1) development of a national land emissions and reporting system for Kenya; and (2) development of applications to better inform land use and management decisions across the country.

The SLEEK is unique in that it generates information on GHG fluxes from the Agriculture, Forest and Other Land Use (AFOLU) sector specifically. This does not include industrial emissions which are accounted for separately. The SLEEK's outputs are generated using a complex multi-source, and multi-layer input system which includes not only remotely observed changes from satellite imagery, but also historical datasets from all land uses in the AFOLU sector, direct measurements from field based permanent sample plots, and extensive inputs generated through modeling. This not only serves to increase the accuracy of the observations, but the inclusion of modeling component to the inputs also enables projections to be made and scenarios to be compared for future planning. This creates additional value for the SLEEK, acting as a decision-support tool to multiple other development processes in the country.
