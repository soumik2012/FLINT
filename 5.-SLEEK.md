Introduction to SLEEK (Bryan)

Policy context for SLEEK (Bryan)
  
Decision: Why only the land sector?

Decision: Scope of problems that SLEEK seeks to address


MRV options considered (Bryan)
 
Decision: why multiple input approach, i.e. sat imagery + aux data (copied from Aus and Can)  
 
Decision: what are the Tier levels and why did Kenya decide to go for a Tier 3 approach? 



* Decision: Modelling approach
* Decision: Pixel based approach
* Decision: Generic approach
  * What parts of SLEEK are generic? (generic has two meanings)
    * Not country specific: possibility to apply the system in other countries
    * Not carbon specific: possibility of other pools (water, economic, etc.)
  * Why a country generic approach is the best option?
    * share cost of developement and maitenance,
    * comparability of emissions,
    * facilitate flow of funds for landscape restoration.
  * Why a pool generic approach is the best option?
* why? this needs more thought. What are the other options to dealing with the other pools?
* what other pools? water pools, economic, other gasses, etc


How did the thinking about SLEEK progress over time? (Bryan)
 
* initially seen as one tool incorporating all data, models, and applications 
* separate out models and data
* separate out the apps
* Data platform available for all apps
* several version of flint simultaneously


* What is the SLEEK Technical Architecture? (Rob & Bryan)
* What is the structure: dataplatform, data cube, scheduler, flint + models, policy application to output, presentation of outputs.
* Why did we decide on this structure: Link to decisions above
* Description of components
  * Data Platform
  * data cube
  * scheduler
  * Flint + models
  * presentation component

What is the science behind SLEEK and sequential steps to implementation have been taken? (Bryan)

Process for producing land-cover maps

* land-cover change detection approach
* sources of maps

Key definitions

* Definition of forests used in SLEEK
* Definition of crops used in SLEEK 


What’s the administrative structure for delivering SLEEK? (Bryan & Dean)

* What teams are building SLEEK?
  * which institutions are involved?
  * role of CCI, GoA, etc
* How did this structure come about?
* What administrative structures have been used?
* Capacity Building
  * Scholarship program
* Progress? MEL?



What’s the administrative structure for running SLEEK? (sustainability underpinning) (Dean & Bryan)

* System for requesting SLEEK applications
  * Overview of agreed objectives and requesting agencies
  * Procedures to add additional objectives
* Objective 1: emissions estimations for UNFCCC (Requesting agency = NEMA)
  * How is the reporting of emissions to the UNFCCC managed through SLEEK?
  * Role of NEMA
    * capacity building
  * Role of power users
  * Role of MEWNR
  * Role of moja.global
* Objective 2: State of the Environment report
  * Role of NEMA
* Objective 3: Forest Tracker
  * Role of KFS
* Objective 4: Crop Insurance
  * how is insurance for crops being managed?
  * role of Ministry of Ag
  * role of KALRO


What input products will be collected and what is the system to collect them? (sustainability underpinning) 
(Dean & Bryan)
 
* System for requesting SLEEK input products
  * Overview of agreed inputs and requesting apps/agencies
  * Procedures to add additional input products
  * How do the product providers connect to SLEEK
* Product provision:
  * For each of the input products below the following information will be collected:
    * responsible agency
    * collection methodology
    * data sources
    * data rescue
    * product input
    * product frequency
    * product quality, units, DB scheme, API,...
    * product QC/QA
 * The following input products will be continuously collected for the SLEEK apps
   * climate data
   * soil type
   * soil management
   * crop type
   * crop acreage
   * crop management
   * forest types
   * forest acreage by type
   * forest management
   * product QC/QA
   * landcover by agreed types

What software option were chosen? (Moses & Rob)
* Open Source
* C++
* Version control
* GitHub
* Testing
* Release management
* Sprints and prioritization and backlogs
