**What was the decision and why?**

The SLEEK tools and structures have been designed so that they are not limited to measuring GHGs, but can be used to inform other sectors, for example water resource management decisions through the incorporation of additional datasets and models.

**Why was the decision necessary?**

The decision to allow SLEEK to incorporate other data-sets in the future is essential to ensuring that the system can continue to develop in-line with the Government of Kenya's evolving needs. This will enhance the sustainability of the system, as the system will become useful for other applications which will generate new clients and users for the system.

**How was the decision reached?**
The decision to preserve this generic nature of the SLEEK was made over a period of a year, through multiple consultations with Kenyan and international experts.
