As in many developing countries, long-term historic datasets were few and the coverage of that data was limited. With this in mind the use of scientific models, in order to generate modeled outputs of emissions from various land uses, was adopted by SLEEK. In order to best represent the various land uses, separate models were used for the major land use classes as guided by the dominant land uses in the country, the IPCC Land Uses and the carbon pools described by the IPCC (i.e. forest land, agricultural land, soils, etc.). Models for generating data on forests, croplands, soils, wetlands have been adopted in order to generate data where previously gaps existed. By separating these models accordingly, each model can operate independently, and generate both outputs for use on their own, and inputs into the generic model, known as the FLINT (Full Land Integration Tool) which will give a complete picture of land-based sector emissions.
