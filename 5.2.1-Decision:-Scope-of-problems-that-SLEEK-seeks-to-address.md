**What problems does SLEEK seek to address?**

SLEEK will do more than simply meet Kenya's reporting obligations under the UNFCCC. The availability of accurate, verifiable data on land use and land use changes in the AFOLU sector will greatly enhance the ability of decision makers across all sectors to create well-informed policy and strategies options regarding the development objectives of Kenya. As mandated in Kenya's constitution, the rights of Kenyans' to clean and healthy environment, and water are fundamentally impacted by good land use decisions across the country. The SLEEK allows users to be well informed about both historic trends and future scenarios in planning development objectives. Kenya's emerging National REDD+ programme will also use the SLEEK as the basis of its National Forest Monitoring System, which will be the basis of Kenya's monitoring, reporting and verification (MRV) system for REDD+ as described in the UNFCCC's Cancun Agreements (Decision 1/CP.16). Furthermore, the generic design of the integration tool in the SLEEK system allows the system to be applied broadly in the region so that it can serve multiple uses in multiple jurisdictions.
 
**Why was the decision necessary?**

As a developing country, with aspirations to achieve middle-income status by 2030, Kenya has a inherent need to implement growth and development strategies based on evidence-based decision making. This is particularly critical in the context of the impacts of development decisions on the environment and natural resource management in the land-based sectors. The decision to design and implement SLEEK with the explicit purposes of delivering outputs that can influence multiple decision making and reporting requirements has impacted the design of the SLEEK in several important ways. First, the ability of the SLEEK to operate with multiple types of input data sets is a key design feature. This allows the SLEEK to not only use historical and incomplete datasets, but to also project trends forward with accuracy, using widely understood models that have been incorporated into the design. This allows SLEEK to be operated in data-deficient areas is by design,such as in other developing country contexts, which have inherent data gaps. 
 
**How was the decision reached?**

The decision was reached in the pre-funding stage of SLEEK. It was formalised at a design document writing workshop held on 8 & 9 August 2012. This process also included extensive consultation with technical expertise and an examination of best practice from other jurisdictions.
