Measuring, Reporting and Verification (MRV), as the name implies involves the detection, measuring, recording and subsequent verification of emissions reductions and removals from an area in an emissions tracking system such as a National GHG Inventory system. MRV is a critical component of the design structure of a viable system for tracking emissions and reporting on those emissions at the UNFCCC level and in other types of land-use decisions. Additionally, MRV systems are critical in proving the veracity of reductions and removals for the purposes of crediting and engaging in results-based payments systems such as REDD+.

The design of MRV systems is left to the individual country implementing the system according to their national circumstances, but must meet international best practice and agreed upon standards as laid out in the decisions of the UNFCCC.
