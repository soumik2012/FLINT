The SLEEK is a comprehensive monitoring system and because of that, it operates in a complex legal and policy environment, across complex social, environment, economic and management scales.  As such the policy context for SLEEK is influenced by myriad policies, legislation and regulatory instruments. In turn, the SLEEK also acts to inform these same legal instruments, through its role as a decision support tool.  Although the SLEEK was formally necessitated in order for Kenya to meet it's commitments to GHG reporting at the UNFCCC level, the expanded design of the SLEEK allows Kenya to use it's outputs to create an informed, defensible and scientifically rigorous legal and policy environment.  Domestically, SLEEK supports Kenya’s national priorities in the land sector. For example, the 2010 Constitution requires Kenya to “ensure sustainable exploitation, utilisation, management, and conservation of the environment and natural resources and to achieve and maintain a tree cover of at least 10 per cent”. These goals are clearly and demonstrably monitored through the information provided by SLEEK. SLEEK will also help Kenya meet the information needs identified by Kenya’s “Vision 2030”, the national long-term development blueprint, and Kenya’s National Climate Change Response Strategy with its associated Forestry Development Plan. The SLEEK design is heavily influenced by policies, acts and regulation that impact governance of the land based sector. These include but are not limited to the following: 

* The Constitution of Kenya
* The Land Act
* The Community Land Act
* The Land (Group Representatives) Act
* The Climate Finance Bill
* The Climate Change Policy
* The Wildlife (Conservation and Management) Act
* The National Climate Change Response Strategy
* The Green Economy Strategy
* The Agriculture Act 
* National Climate Change Action Plan 
* Kenya's international commitments, treaties and obligations (i.e. UNFCCC)

Additionally, the SLEEK integrates with Kenya's emerging national policy instruments for combating climate change from the conversion of forests. The SLEEK will serve to greatly enhance Kenya's national aspirations for REDD+ through informing key components of the emerging national REDD+ strategy. The functionality of SLEEK was identified as the system requirement to support coordination and MRV of Kenya’s REDD+ readiness program under the World Bank’s Forest Carbon Partnership Facility (FCPF) and through further, targeted support from the UN-REDD Programme. Furthermore, SLEEK aligns with the country’s MRV roadmap, which includes steps for data collection and improved data management.
