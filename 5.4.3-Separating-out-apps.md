In the initial development of SLEEK there was little clarity about how the components of the system fit together. To help clarify the operations of the system, the components of SLEEK were separated into their composite components. The key data-sets and the FLINT were separated from the tools (otherwise known as 'apps') that would be used to access the outputs of the FLINT. The initial tools that were proposed in the early stages of SLEEK were as follows:

Reporting Tool: a dedicated tool that would be used by the agency responsible for UNFCCC reporting. The tool would be customizable, and allow the user to stipulate the rules being employed in determining the UNFCCC reporting requirements.
Policy Emission Scenario Tool (EST): The Policy EST allows Kenya to run scenarios to assess the impact of policy choice on the country's emissions. These policies can include forest management policy, land-use scenarios and agriculture practices.

Project Emission Scenario Tool (EST): The Project EST will allow users to select a specific area and model different land-management practices to assess the impact of land-management on emissions. This tool will allow REDD+ project developers to measure the impact of land-management decisions on sequestration and emissions.
 
During the SLEEK development process it also became apparent that there was opportunity to use the SLEEK data to meet a number of goals beyond just emissions estimation. To support this development process, the decision was made to allow developers to propose 'apps' that access SLEEK data. From a governance perspective, these would operate in a similar way to the three apps that were initially proposed, with users being able to access the SLEEK data-products and the FLINT output as required.
