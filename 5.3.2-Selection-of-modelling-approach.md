**What was the decision and why?**
The decision to include scientific modelling as part of the approach to emissions estimation in SLEEK's design was made on the basis of the need to generate accurate inputs from the land-based sectors in the absence of historical datasets.

**Why was the decision necessary?**
Kenya, like many developing country contexts, does not have a wealth of historical data on land use and land use change in the AFOLU sector. In order to increase the accuracy of the emissions estimates, and in light of these data gaps, it is essential that a scientifically rigorous and defensible strategy for generating outputs from each of the land-based sectors be used.  These outputs will be subsequently integrated into the generic integration tool. The use of modelling is a widely acceptable, and scientifically rigorous method of generating outputs that can be used in the generic integration tool. 

**How was the decision reached?**
The use of models was identified as an option for generating outputs during the design phase of SLEEK. Through consultation with subject matter experts in the AFOLU sector in Kenya, the need for generating accurate data for future scenario planning was immediately identifiable.
