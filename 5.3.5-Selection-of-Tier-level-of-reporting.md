**What was the decision and why?**

The UNFCCC uses both Tiers and Approaches in design options for National GHG Inventories. These are articulated in both the 2003 IPCC Good Practice Guidelines and further updated in the the 2006 IPCC Guidelines for National Greenhouse Gas Inventories http://www.ipcc-nggip.iges.or.jp /public/2006gl/vol4.html These guidelines allow for best practice to be replicated across various contextual realities in member states. The IPCC guidance suggests three possible Approaches to accounting for land based emissions in a national MRV design. These are:
 
**Approach 1:** This approach is defined by reporting on the total land area, disaggregated by the six IPCC land use categories, but without data on conversions between the various land uses. The total land area is usually the political boundaries of the country, and the disaggregated land uses should add up to the total land area of the country. Approach 1 tracks land use changes by simply tracking the change to the total area in a given land use.  However, it does not attribute land use conversion from one land use to another and it is not spatially explicit and so patterns of land use change are not attributable to specific areas.  This is usually because data on land use changes, and location of those changes is unavailable. Results for this approach can be presented in a table form, without spatially explicit representation.

**Approach 2:** This approach is similar to Approach 1 but with the added specificity of tracking land use changes from one of the six IPCC land use categories to another. For example, the approach demonstrates that the changes observed in a forest land total land area are due to forest land being converted specifically to another use such as cropland. Again, the data can be presented in a table or a matrix, showing the land area changes between land use categories. It is not spatially explicit. As such Approach 2 also often excludes tracking of lands through multiple classes (for example, several conversions on one land unit. This is important in areas where land use is dynamic.
  
**Approach 3:** This approach builds on the previous approaches by presented the land use and land use change data of the AFOLU sector in a spatially explicit manner. The data that is key to this is spatial location information from each of the land use changes over time. This allows for analysis that is linked to specific land use category changes with known carbon stock amounts, and therefore potential emissions profiles for those changes when tracked. It helps decision makers see exactly where land use conversions are taking place, mapping them against known land class strata and inferring emissions fluxes that could be associated with those land use changes over time. The results of Approach 3 can be represented in Land Area Matrices as used in Approach 2, but in this case are a summary of the land use data rather than an input to emissions estimation. 
 
More information on each of these Approaches is available in the 2006 IPCC Guidance on National GHG Inventories, Vol. 4, Chapter 3 available here.

These approaches represent different methods that can be employed to arrive at a an acceptable conclusion as to the status of GHG emissions in a country. The basic principle is that an emissions estimate is a function of the activity data in a given state, multiplied by the emissions factors associated with a type of land use or class. The UNFCCC requires that a country states their Approach so as to allow verification of the methods and endorsement of the outcome in reporting to the UNFCCC. Many developed countries, such as Canada and Finland, have extensive historical datasets on land use and land use change, particularly in forestry. However, most developing countries do not have National Forest Inventory data thus causing challenges for assessing historical trends in land-use area. Therefore, the only way to represent changes in land and land use in a consistent, and transparent approach is to use satellite imagery and remotely sensed data, as in Approach 3. Although this limits the historical timeframe to roughly 20 years, this Approach is considered robust enough to meet UNFCCC requirements. In this case, Kenya has chosen to use Approach 3, specifically, to use data to track GHG emissions from spatially explicit land uses and land use changes in the AFOLU category.

Additionally, the IPCC's 2006 guidance describes Tiers for reporting which allow reporters to use a range of techniques in their calculations of emissions. These Tiers range from 1 to 3 with each Tier increase having an associated increasing level of detail and accuracy. For example Tier 1 allows for the use of defaults emissions factors, which are acceptable, but may not reflect specific contextual realities in the jurisdiction in which they are applied. Tier 3 reflect contextually specific data, and often uses direct measurements from sample plots, of GHGs and is increasingly accurate level of measurement in emissions calculations. For the purposes of reporting to the UNFCCC, not all pools will be reported on using a Tier 3 method, depending on the contextual significance of their contribution and on factors such as the costs of measurement. However, for all significant pools of GHGs from the land use sector, Kenya is aspiring to use a system to report at Tier 3. The SLEEK uses measurements form permanent sample plots, combined with extensive modelling of emissions scenarios for each land use, is able to generate the information needed to present a spatially explicit, contextually informed level of outputs for most GHG categories. This will inform not only reporting to the UNFCCC, but will assist in decision making and resource planning at various levels in the country as well.

With this in mind Kenya has chosen to report GHGs using a Approach 3, Tier 3 where the contextual realities (such as cost, significance to the inventory etc.) are relevant.

**Why was the decision necessary?**

The UNFCCC requires that countries publish their approaches in the submission of their reports. Furthermore, the level of detail, and the availability of accurate information for planning purposes in Kenya's development agenda was deemed a reason why data of this level of accuracy was needed.

**How was the decision reached?**

The decision was reached through the examination of the reporting requirements to the UNFCCC, coupled with an examination of the contextual reality of Kenya's data needs for decision making. Through a series of consultations with technical and policy experts in Kenya, the decision was deemed to be appropriate for not only meeting international reporting obligations but equally delivering on data needs for Kenya's development.
