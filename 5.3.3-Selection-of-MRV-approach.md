Monitoring, Reporting and Verification is a fundamental aspect of emissions reporting, both at the UNFCCC and in parallel mechanisms such as REDD+. MRV is a requirement for providing, credible, accurate estimations of emissions and is a requirement for countries that seek results-based financing for action on emissions. MRV systems can vary in their design, implementation and operation based on the national circumstances.

**What was the decision and why?**

In Kenya, the decision to utilize SLEEK as the national MRV system reflects a desire to harmonize multiple sectoral inputs into one centralized reporting system. This desire is articulated in Vision2030 and in the National Climate Change Action Plan, where the emphasis has been on integrated approaches across all sectors, combating climate change whilst creating a positive development trajectory for the country. Kenya's primary economic and developmental emphasis is on land-based sectors such as agriculture, pastoralism, conservation and tourism, all of whose development impacts land use patterns and thus emissions. SLEEK, as an MRV system primarily focused on the land based sectors, provides a single, accessible system in which multiple sectors have a vested interest for accurate, credible information to support decision making. An MRV system such as SLEEK also meets the requirements of results-based funds and for the reporting requirements inherent in the UNFCCC for the land-based sectors.
 
**Why was the decision necessary?**

The choice to use SLEEK as the MRV system for multiple needs in Kenya ( i.e. REDD+, UNFCCC etc.) adds legitimacy to the system and increases the sustainability of the program, as multiple sectors and users will benefit from the generic, broad approach used in SLEEK.

**How was the decision reached?**

The decision was reached through broad consultation with Kenyan and international experts, during the design phases and early implementation of the SLEEK.
